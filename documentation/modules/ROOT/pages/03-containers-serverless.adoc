=== Enabling user services run whether user logged in or not

We are going to deploy the container as an unprivileged user (e.g. rootless). 

As we need to use systemd to run the container we will need that these units we are going to use can be executed every time a request is received.

When systemd units are used by non-root user are only started when the user starts a session and they are terminated when the user closes the session. Obviously this is not the behaviour we want to run an application.

As we are going to use the user **core** to run the Serverless container we need to allow this user services run whether core user is logged or not:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
[root@rhel9 ~]# cat > /etc/systemd/system/enable-linger.service << EOF

[root@rhel9 ~]#

=== Building the containerized application

We will use the following application: https://github.com/alexwhen/docker-2048[2048 game].

You can use your own computer or the RHEL 9 server to build it. If you use the RHEL 9 server use a different user that the **core** user.

In this case we will use the RHEL 9 server and we build the container image using the **workshop** user.

You will need to clone the repository:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
[workshop@rhel9 ~]$ mkdir Dockerfiles
[workshop@rhel9 Dockerfiles]$ cd Dockerfiles
[workshop@rhel9 Dockerfiles]$ git clone https://github.com/alexwhen/docker-2048.git
[workshop@rhel9 Dockerfiles]$ ln -s docker-2048/ 2048

As this is a web application and we will use nginx we will need the nginx configuration file:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
[workshop@rhel9 Dockerfiles]$ cat > nginx.conf << EOF
worker_processes  1;
include /usr/share/nginx/modules/*.conf;
events {
    worker_connections 1024;
}
http {
    log_format  main  '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" '
                      '$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
                      '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"';
    access_log  /var/log/nginx/access.log  main;
    sendfile            on;
    tcp_nopush          on;
    tcp_nodelay         on;
    keepalive_timeout   65;
    types_hash_max_size 4096;
    include             /etc/nginx/mime.types;
    default_type        application/octet-stream;
    # Load modular configuration files from the /etc/nginx/conf.d directory.
    # See http://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_core_module.html#include
    # for more information.
    include /opt/app-root/etc/nginx.d/*.conf;
    server {
        listen       8081;
        server_name  localhost;
        root         /opt/app-root/src;
        # Load configuration files for the default server block.
        include /opt/app-root/etc/nginx.default.d/*.conf;
        location / {
            include /etc/nginx/mime.types;
            root   /opt/app-root/src/2048;
            index  index.html;
        }
    }
}
EOF
[workshop@rhel9 Dockerfiles]$

Now we are going to create the image container. We will write the following Dockerfile:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
[workshop@rhel9 Dockerfiles]$ cat > Dockerfile.2048.rhel9.v1 << EOF
# buildah build -f Dockerfile.2048.rhel9.v1 -t 2048-demoday:v1
# podman run --rm -d -p 8080:8081 localhost/2048-demoday:v1
FROM registry.redhat.io/rhel9/nginx-120
MAINTAINER ---YOUR NAME--- <YOUR EM@IL> 
COPY 2048 /opt/app-root/src
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
EXPOSE 8081
ENTRYPOINT ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
EOF
[workshop@rhel9 Dockerfiles]$

TIP: We are using an image with nginx provided by Red Hat. If you do not have access to Red Hat images you can look for a different image but in this case you probably need to modify the Dockerfile because the application source code could change its location and the nginx configuration file as well.

If you are using the Red Hat container image you will need to login to Red Hat's registry:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
[workshop@rhel9 Dockerfiles]$ podman login registry.redhat.io
Username: <YOUR RED HAT USER HERE>
Password: <YOUR PASSWORD HERE>
Login Succeeded
[workshop@rhel9 Dockerfiles]$

Now to build the container image:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
[workshop@rhel9 Dockerfiles]$ buildah build -f Dockerfile.2048.rhel9.v1 -t 2048-demoday:v1
...
[workshop@rhel9 Dockerfiles]$ podman images
REPOSITORY                          TAG         IMAGE ID      CREATED        SIZE
localhost/2048-demoday              v1          d48137cd5225  5 seconds ago  382 MB
registry.redhat.io/rhel9/nginx-120  latest      8b24fbc725c8  6 weeks ago    379 MB
[workshop@rhel9 Dockerfiles]$

Now we will have to upload the image to one registry. We will use https://quay.io[Quay] but you can use a different one. As we are going to upload the image we need to login:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
[workshop@rhel9 Dockerfiles]$ podman login quay.io
Username: <YOUR REGISTRY USER HERE>
Password: <YOUR PASSWORD HERE>
Login Succeeded
[workshop@rhel9 Dockerfiles]$

We need to tag the image and upload it to the registry, so you will need to change the following according your registry and account:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
[workshop@rhel9 Dockerfiles]$ podman tag localhost/2048-demoday:v1 quay.io/rhte_2019/2048-demoday:latest
[workshop@rhel9 Dockerfiles]$ podman images
REPOSITORY                          TAG         IMAGE ID      CREATED        SIZE
localhost/2048-demoday              v1          d48137cd5225  9 minutes ago  382 MB
quay.io/rhte_2019/2048-demoday      latest      d48137cd5225  9 minutes ago  382 MB
registry.redhat.io/rhel9/nginx-120  latest      8b24fbc725c8  6 weeks ago    379 MB
[workshop@rhel9 Dockerfiles]$ podman push quay.io/rhte_2019/2048-demoday:latest
...
[workshop@rhel9 Dockerfiles]$

Now the image is ready to be deployed.

=== Deploying Serverless containers

Serverless containers are containers that are started when requests are received and the container will be stopped when no requests are received.

This is how the serverless application will work:

image::serverless/podman-serverless.png[]

The first time the container image is executed it will be downloaded from the registry. So we will create a systemd unit that will downloaded the image from the registry when the server boots to reduce the response time in the first application request.

So as the **core** user we will create the directories where the systemd units will be created:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
[core@rhel9 ~]$ mkdir -p .config/systemd/user
[core@rhel9 ~]$

Now we will create the systemd unit to download the image from the registry to the server:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
[core@rhel9 ~]$ cat > .config/systemd/user/pre-pull-container-image.service << EOF
[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=podman pull quay.io/rhte_2019/2048-demoday:latest
RestartSec=30
Restart=on-failure
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target default.target
EOF
[core@rhel9 ~]$

TIP: Replace the image for your own's one.

As we are going to expose the application to the world we will need create a systemd socket. We will use the port 8080 to expose the application to the world so we will create the socket:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
[core@rhel9 ~]$ cat > .config/systemd/user/container-httpd-proxy.socket << EOF
[Socket]
ListenStream=192.168.1.144:8080
FreeBind=true
[Install]
WantedBy=sockets.target
EOF
[core@rhel9 ~]$

TIP: Replace the 192.168.1.144 IP for your server's one.

As root user we will open the 8080 port:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
[root@rhel9 ~]# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=8080/tcp
success
[root@rhel9 ~]# firewall-cmd --reload
success
[root@rhel9 ~]#

Now we will create a proxy socket that will start the container and will forward the requests from the 8080 port to the container:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
[core@rhel9 ~]$ cat > .config/systemd/user/container-httpd-proxy.service << EOF
[Unit]
Requires=container-httpd.service
After=container-httpd.service
Requires=container-httpd-proxy.socket
After=container-httpd-proxy.socket
[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-socket-proxyd --exit-idle-time=10s 127.0.0.1:8080
EOF
[core@rhel9 ~]$
 
TIP: Adjust **--exit-idle-time** as you prefer. This  parameter is used to stop the container after this inactivity time, in this case 10 seconds. Bare in mind that although you are not sending requests to the application maybe the application itself is sending some traffic. That means that it could take a bit more time than 10 seconds to stop the application. This application takes one minute or so to be stopped. You can check the man page for **systemd-socket-proxy** to get more information.

It is a good idea to use podman to create the unit that will start the container. For that under the user **workshop** where we create the container image:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
[workshop@rhel9 ~]$ podman run --rm -d -p 8080:8081 --name demoday localhost/2048-demoday:v1
f0716002b0458d1720fe6d16264b13c101fa61b11315694c9d016b839ec139a5
[workshop@rhel9 ~]$ podman generate systemd --new demoday > container-httpd.service 
[workshop@rhel9 ~]$ podman stop demoday
demoday
[workshop@rhel9 ~]$ 

TIP: Remember that the container exposes the 8081 port.

Now we need to copy the file **container-httpd.service** to the directory **.config/systemd/user** under the user's **core** home directory:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
[core@rhel9 ~]$ cat .config/systemd/user/container-httpd.service
# container-f0716002b0458d1720fe6d16264b13c101fa61b11315694c9d016b839ec139a5.service

Documentation=man:podman-generate-systemd(1)

ExecStartPre=/bin/rm -f %t/%n.ctr-id

ExecStop=/usr/bin/podman stop --ignore --cidfile=%t/%n.ctr-id
ExecStopPost=/usr/bin/podman rm -f --ignore --cidfile=%t/%n.ctr-id
Type=notify
NotifyAccess=all
[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
[core@rhel9 ~]$ 

We are almost done, but we need some additional configuration.

We have configured the proxy socket to stop the container after 10 seconds of inactivity so we must configure the systemd unit as well. For that in the **container-httpd.service** we have to add to the **[Unit]** service the following:

[source]
StopWhenUnneeded=true

Now you can reboot the server.

After the server boots, connect to the server using the **core** user. Wait a bit and check that the container image has been downloaded:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
[core@rhel9 ~]$ podman images
REPOSITORY                      TAG         IMAGE ID      CREATED      SIZE
quay.io/rhte_2019/2048-demoday  latest      d48137cd5225  3 hours ago  382 MB
[core@rhel9 ~]$

You can check that the **IMAGE ID** is the same that the image that was created under the **workshop** user and uploaded to the registry.

Check that there is no container running:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
[core@rhel9 ~]$ podman ps
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE       COMMAND     CREATED     STATUS      PORTS       NAMES
[core@rhel9 ~]$

Now we are going to check that there is a bind socket in the 8080 port:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
[core@rhel9 ~]$ netstat -tunlp
(Not all processes could be identified, non-owned process info
 will not be shown, you would have to be root to see it all.)
Active Internet connections (only servers)

udp6       0      0 ::1:323                 :::*                                -              
[core@rhel9 ~]$

As we can see **systemd** is listening in the 8080 port.

Access the application using a browser:

image::serverless/2048v1.png[]

Now we can see that the container has been started:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
[core@rhel9 ~]$ podman ps
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                                  COMMAND     CREATED         STATUS             PORTS                     NAMES
98682e2c7b05  quay.io/rhte_2019/2048-demoday:latest              14 seconds ago  Up 15 seconds ago  127.0.0.1:8080->8081/tcp  demoday
[core@rhel9 ~]$

Stop playing the game and wait a minute or so:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
[core@rhel9 ~]$ podman ps
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                                  COMMAND     CREATED         STATUS             PORTS                     NAMES
[core@rhel9 ~]$

So after a period of inactivity the container is stopped.

Access the application again and check that the container is started and it stops after an inactivity time.
